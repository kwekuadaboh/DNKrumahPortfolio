              The main objective study was to examine the relationship between credit risk and
              profitability of rural banks in Ghana. The motivating
              question is, if commercial banks with larger capital reserve and capital adequacy are even at
              risk to the credit risks then how much more that of rural banks.

              The descriptive research design was used for this particular study. This design was
              chosen because it may be either be time variant or invariant. That is flexible with regard to its
              approach &lpar;quantitative and qualitative&rpar;. The choice of this design is informed by the view of
              Creswell, Clark, Gutmann and Hanson &lpar;2015&rpar; that this design is flexible and can even
              incorporate causal or experimental studies. Data was sourced from the Microfinance Information
              Exchange &lpar;MIX&rpar;dataset. A dataset housed by the World Bank on microfinance institutions
              and rural banks in the world.

            <div class="toggle__content" role="toggle">
              In the descriptive statistics, almost all the variables were seen to be normally
              distributed. Before the main model some diagnostic tests conducted such as the
              heteroscedasticity and tolerance &lpar;<abbr title="Variance Inflation Factor">VIF</abbr>&rpar; were all
              passed. The Hausman selection model
              preferred the fixed effect model over the random effect model. All the variables were
              statistically significant and while <abbr title="Non Performing Loans">NPL</abbr>, and <abbr
                title="Loan Loss Rate">LLR</abbr> were negatively

              and size positively affect the banksâ€™ profitability. The study also had enough evidence to
              reject all the study hypotheses that no relationship exists between credit risk variables &lpar;<abbr

            <div class="toggle__content" role="toggle">
              It can be concluded that credit risks are very instrumental to the profitability of a
              bank. This conclusion is premised on the basis that all the variables in the study measuring
              credit risk were significant and followed the expected signs per the study. Thus for banks to
              be profitable they should give close consideration to the health of the capital and asset, they
              should also be mindful of how loans are granted and above all be mindful on the risk they put
              themselves through.

              <ul class="ul-inner">
                <li>Banks are advised to have up their capital adequacy since it provides cushion against
                  losses and also boosts the confidence of the depositors, public and the regulatory
                  authority to do more business.</li>

                <li>Banks must also be wary on the rate at which credits are lost to either inefficiencies or
                  investments. This is because the higher the rates, the rate the lower their confidence in
                  business and profit margins.</li>

                <li>Furthermore, banks should find ways of growing deposits or savings. This is because
                  it increases their assets and dominance or size in doing business. It also helps the
                  banks have access to more cash for investments.</li>
